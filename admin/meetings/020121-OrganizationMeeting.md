Features
- Goal for today: flesh out features for exploratory coding team to start experimenting
- Focus: bare bones functionality
- 5 main stages of Pomo Technique
  1. Planning
    - simple table: task name, estimated pomos, actual pomos taken
  2. Tracking 
    - Record completed sessions only
    - Include distracting thoughts and tally of external distractions
  3. Recording
    - Add tracked data to spreadsheet or database
  4. Processing
    - Assess tracked and recorded data
  5. Visualization
+ Example use cases from lecture:
  + Studying, office environment, health reasons
+ Break down process into Versions
+ Miro brainstorming: go through sticky notes to confirm categorizations of Must, Should, etc.  

Teams
+ Estimating time of tasks, finish medium and high fidelity renders first, wireframes
  + Managers *(Nick, Anastasiia)* - work on ADRs and Project Roadmap
  + Coding team *(Anshul, Kewen, Dan)* will work on exploratory coding for now
  + Design *(Michael, Kyeling, Ravi, Ryan)* will work on documents - interface, design docs, high and medium fidelity renders
+ Decision: move Javascript and System Diagrams under Coding team task and have HTML/CSS under Design team
+ User Centered Documents is something we'll all work on

Daily standups
+ 10-15 minutes each day
+ Will take notes on them, need an asynchronous document
+ Create Slack channel where everyone throws in their updates, have one person copy paste into GitHub
+ Make a bot to send reminders, have it in by 11:59 pm

To Do this week:
- Project Roadmap
- ADR
- Medium and High Fideltiy Renders
- Breakout rooms
- Talk about testing, set up GitHub

Breakout room recap:
- Design - flowchart similar to Lab 4
  - Decision question: what should happen when user presses "End session" button or finishes task?
    - Display stats from session -> option to start new session -> refresh to new timer page
- Coding
  - Started on GitHub issues, if anyone has anything to add, ping a member of the coding team or fill out template
- Slack channels for each team
  - To account for bus factor, others will still have access to a team's channel but can choose to mute it

**Anything on the agenda that was not discussed:**  None


## Concluding notes:

**Decisions made:** 
+ Starting to form division of roles/teams
+ Design decisions will be coming as Design team finalizes the medium and high fideltiy renders
+ Standup in standups Slack channel by 11:59 each day - Kyeling will add these to GitHub (new standup subfolder within meetings)

**When the meeting finished:** 9:02 pm
