## Agenda of what was discussed:

**Old business:** 
+ Finalize documents from brainstorming process to turn in:
  + [X] Meeting notes from brainstorming session(s)
  + [ ] Diagrams and ideas (in Miro, Figma, etc) in /specs/ folder
+ User centered thinking documents
  + Last time: personas
  + Today: user stories
    + Decision: format them as sticky notes to give the impression of individual, diverse voices
  + Link to [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lWxPKec=/)

**New business:** 
+ User stories: keep in mind that these should be user desires that lead to a feature
+ Use cases:
+ Get started on design/UI
  + What the timer will look like
  + Rough interface + flowchart
+ Start thinking about the other documents

+ Main webpage design
  + Timer in center
    + At the top of the timer box display what type of session, e.g. work, long break, short break
  + Volume/sound options
  + Color-changing background
  + Include tasks on right side, optional (hideable) stats on left
  + Keep everything on one page for simplicity
  + ? is a section link to FAQ farther down on the page
  + End session button at the very bottom to encourage 
  
+ Deciding roles
  + Maybe do this asynchronously through a poll on Slack
  + Our group is pretty non role-oriented, try a more fluid approach with assigning tasks each week instead of roles?
  + Assign primary role + secondary role
  + Assign roles first and then people can pick up roles through tickets
  + Additional role of organizer - keep track of project

**Anything on the agenda that was not discussed:** 
+ ADRs: meeting times, how we're deciding roles


## Concluding notes:

**Decisions made:** 
+ Kyeling will take notes for all future meetings
+ Decisions on webpage design (see above)
+ Roles: select interests in Slack
+ Nick will make temporary documents in respective GitHub directories by today

**When the meeting finished:** 12:49 pm
