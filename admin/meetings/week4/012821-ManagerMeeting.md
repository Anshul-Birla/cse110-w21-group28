**Agenda of what was discussed:**
*Old business:* None

*New business:*
+ Past assignment feedback
+ Expectations for brainstorming assignment
+ System diagrams - what tasks are being taken care of
+ Pomodoro timer - is the long break combined with the 5-min break from the previous pomo?
+ Design question - easier to just have one long break
+ Potential pitfalls?
  + Previous iterations of the course: given something to make and what to turn in each week, focus on specific technology
  + Recent iterations: make whatever you want, focus on creativity
  + Pitfalls in Gary’s course:
    + Producing documents but not working on coding
    + Rushing project in last 2 weeks of quarter
  + This course: focus on project management
    + Start early, communicate often
+ Are we allowed to use StackOverflow? Sim will get back to us on that
+ UI design - specific software recommended?
  + Figma
  + Miro also okay - frames, somewhat interactive
+ Grading
  + Won’t be comparing projects, acknowledge that teams have varied levels of ability and encounter different issues
  + Focus on process, have documents that can be referred to, user-centered design thinking before jumping in, the final product isn’t the focus
  + May have rubrics later on, but currently none
  
Deliverables
+ Project Pitch - when to work on?
  + Doesn’t have to be finished by Sunday, but should be relatively fleshed out by next week and finished within next two weeks
+ Overarching decisions - what’s considered a big enough decision to be documented?
  + Roles assigned to people
  + Anything that affects the whole group, e.g. changing meeting times
+ User-centered documents - what goes where? personas, stories, use cases - are these different deliverables?
  + Personas - how different users approach different use cases differently
  + User stories - a story that’s to be implemented
  + Think of the product from different people’s perspectives and think of what features they would want in it
    + e.g. teacher might want to show the timer to their students -> add a feature to project it on screen
  + Accessibility
    + e.g. older person might want larger font
  + Even if interface changes, functionality is established
    + e.g. younger person - shorter attention span, gamify (forest/tree growing apps)
+ System diagrams - to confirm, last step before coding? Yes
+ Project Roadmap - these are the targets we want to hit by week 6, week 7, etc? Yes
  + In parallel to design, start research into hosting, etc.   
  
+ Are we allowed to use open-source icons, figures on figma? yes
  + low-fidelity designs that are easy to scrap and start over
+ Interface design vs System diagrams vs User-centered thinking documents - how to differentiate between these?
  + System diagrams - maintenance
    + How tasks get updated, how code interacts with other code
  + User-centered design - flow of clicking on buttons, etc
    + Might have flows invisible to the user
  + Interface design - includes user-centered design flow + all the parts, i.e. implementation/coding perspective


*Anything on the agenda that was not discussed:* None

*Decisions made:* None

**When the meeting finished:** 7:03 pm
