## Context and Problem Statement

Whether or not we should use Cypress as our testing framework.


## Decision Drivers 

* Not compatible with Windows
* JEST does a great job in testing
* Already implemeted a way around testing without Cypress by implementing strict code coverage requirements for jest tests
* There is a lot of overhead to implement at this point in project

## Considered Options

* To use Cypress and start the implementation
* Not to use Cypress


## Decision Outcome

Team has decided not to use Cypress as our current testing pipeline/framework already does very thorough testing.
