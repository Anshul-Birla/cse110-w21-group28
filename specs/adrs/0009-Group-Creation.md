# Group Formation

## Context and Problem Statement

We were not being productive enough with everyone working on the same thing.
Groups were needed to increase productivity.

## Considered Options

* Number of groups
* Number of members per group
* Assignments for each group

## Decision Outcome

Three groups:

* Managers: Nick, Anastasiia \
Oversee all groups progress, decrease bus factor by being involved with all groups, point out possible issues that arise from having seperate teams, help with groups that may have fallen behind on a task.\
Current tasks are Project Pitch, making the ADR, and User Centered Documents
* Designers: Michael, Kyeling, Ryan, Ravi\
Main designers of the app. Are responsible for artwork/aesthetic choices (HTML CSS) and the flow of the app. Will be working closely with coders.\
Current tasks are Interface Design Documents, System Diagrams, and User Centered Documents
* Coders/Feature Explorers: Anshul, Kewen, Dan\
Main coders of the app. Are responsible for creating the framework and data structures necessary to store user information and use it for meta analysis. Develop the cicd/pipeline to automate/regulate testing, deployment. Figure out which beneficial APIâ€™s to use.\
Current Tasks are Project Roadmap, System Diagrams, and User Centered Documents
