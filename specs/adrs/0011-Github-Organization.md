# Updated Repo Organziation

## Context and Problem Statement

We wanted to create a seperate branch from main for repo insurance.


## Decision Outcome

Created the meeting notes branch.

* This branch will contain all of the meeting notes, brainstorming activities, and specs.
* This will leave main to only contain code/folders used for the project
