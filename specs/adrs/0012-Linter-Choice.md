# What Linter Should we use?

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide what linter to use for code linting and to ensure that
code is written in a consistent style.

## Considered Options

* ESLint
* JSLint

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: ESLint

* ESLint has the most support out of the linters we looked at
* ESLint is industry standard
