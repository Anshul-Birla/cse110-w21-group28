# Standup Notes

## Context and Problem Statement

We wanted a way to stay informed with what each team member is working on/struggling on each day.

## Considered Options

* Having a meeting
* Asynchronous meeting
* Standup bot on Slack

## Decision Outcome

Standup bot on Slack

* Each day we will DM the standup bot the answers to the following questions:
  * What have you completed since the last meeting?
  * What do you plan to complete by the next meeting?
  * What is getting in your way?
 *Kyeling will create the standup doc and put it into the repo
